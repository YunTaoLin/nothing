<p class="letter_spacing">Some of the stories we know and like are many hundreds of years old.</p>
<p class="text_indent">Among them are Aesop’s fables. A fable is a short story made up to teach a lesson.Most fables are about animals. In them animals talk.</p>
<p class="line_height"> Many of our common sayings come from fables. “Sour Grapes” is one of them.It comes from the fable “The Fox and the Grapes.” In the story a fox saw a bunch of grapes hanging from a vine. </p>
<p class="text_decoration">They looked ripe and good to eat. But they were rather high.</p>
<p class="text_transform">He jumped and jumped, but he could not reach them. At last he gave up.</p>
<p class="text_align">As he went away he said.<br> “Those grapes were sour anyway.” <br>Now we say, <br>Sour Grapes! when someone pretends he does not want something he tried to get but couldn’t. </p>
